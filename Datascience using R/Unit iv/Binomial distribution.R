#The binomial distribution model deals with finding the probability of success of an event
#which has only two possible outcomes in a series of experiments.
#For example, tossing of a coin always gives a head or a tail.

#R has four in-built functions to generate binomial distribution.
#They are described below.

#dbinom(x, size, prob)
#pbinom(x, size, prob)
#qbinom(p, size, prob)
#rbinom(n, size, prob)
#Following is the description of the parameters used âˆ’

#x is a vector of numbers.

#p is a vector of probabilities.

#n is number of observations.

#size is the number of trials.

#prob is the probability of success of each trial.

#dbinom()
#This function gives the probability density distribution at each point.


#Live Demo
#The probability of finding exactly 3 heads in tossing a coin repeatedly for 10 times is
#estimated during the binomial distribution.
