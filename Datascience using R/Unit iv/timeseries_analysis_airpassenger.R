#Box plot across months will give us a sense on seasonal effect
#Important Inferences
#1. The year on year trend clearly shows that the #passengers have been increasing without fail.
#2. The variance and the mean value in July and August is much higher than rest of the months.
#3. Even though the mean value of each month is quite different their variance is small. 
#Hence, we have strong seasonal effect with a cycle of 12 months or less.


#We know that we need to address two issues before we test stationary series. 
#One, we need to remove unequal variances. We do this using log of the series. 
#Two, we need to address the trend component. We do this by taking difference of the series. 
#Now, letâ€™s test the resultant series.
