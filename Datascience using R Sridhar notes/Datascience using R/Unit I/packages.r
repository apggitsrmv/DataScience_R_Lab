#R packages are a collection of R functions, complied code and sample data. They are stored under a directory
#called "library" in the R environment. By default, R installs a set of packages during installation. 
#More packages are added later, when they are needed for some specific purpose. When we start the R console, 
#only the default packages are available by default. Other packages which are already installed have to be
#loaded explicitly to be used by the R program that is going to use them.

#All the packages available in R language are listed at R Packages.

#Below is a list of commands to be used to check, verify and usea the R packages.

#Check Available R Packages
#Get library locations containing R packages

#Get all packages currently loaded in the R environment

#Install a New Package
#There are two ways to add new R packages. One is installing directly from the CRAN directory 
#and another is downloading the package to your local system and installing it manually.

#Install directly from CRAN
#The following command gets the packages directly from CRAN webpage and installs the package 
#in the R environment. You may be prompted to choose a nearest mirror. 
#Choose the one appropriate to your location.


#install.packages("Package Name")

# Install the package named "XML".
install.packages("XML")


#Install package manually
#Go to the link R Packages to download the package needed. Save the package as a .zip file in a suitable location in the local system.

#Now you can run the following command to install this package in the R environment.

#install.packages(file_name_with_path, repos = NULL, type = "source")

# Install the package named "XML"
install.packages("E:/XML_3.98-1.3.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")

#Load Package to Library
#Before a package can be used in the code, it must be loaded to the current R environment.
#You also need to load a package that is already installed previously but not available 
#in the current environment.

#A package is loaded using the following command âˆ’

#library("package Name", lib.loc = "path to library")

# Load the package named "XML"
install.packages("E:/XML_3.98-1.3.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")
