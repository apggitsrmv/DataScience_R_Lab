#Factors are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and store 
#it as levels. They can store both strings and integers. They are useful in the columns 
#which have a limited number of unique values. Like "Male, "Female" and True, False etc. 
#They are useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.

#Factors are created using the factor () function by taking a vector as input.

# Create a vector as input.
data <- c("East","West","East","North","North","East","West","West","West","East","North")

print(data)
print(is.factor(data))

# Apply the factor function.
factor_data <- factor(data)

print(factor_data)
print(is.factor(factor_data))

#Factors in Data Frame
#On creating any data frame with a column of text data, R treats the text column as 
#categorical data and creates factors on it.

# Create the vectors for data frame.
height <- c(132,151,162,139,166,147,122)
weight <- c(48,49,66,53,67,52,40)
gender <- c("male","male","female","female","male","female","male")

# Create the data frame.
input_data <- data.frame(height,weight,gender)
print(input_data)

# Test if the gender column is a factor.
print(is.factor(input_data$gender))
print(factor(input_data$gender))
# Print the gender column so see the levels.
print(input_data$gender)

#Changing the Order of Levels
#The order of the levels in a factor can be changed by applying 
#the factor function again with new order of the levels.

data <- c("East","West","East","North","North","East","West",
          "West","West","East","North","South","South")
# Create the factors
factor_data <- factor(data)
print(factor_data)

# Apply the factor function with required order of the level.
new_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North","South"))
print(new_order_data)


#Generating Factor Levels
#We can generate factor levels by using the gl() function. It takes two integers as input 
#which indicates how many levels and how many times each level.

#Syntax
#gl(n, k, labels)
#Following is the description of the parameters used âˆ’

#n is a integer giving the number of levels.

#k is a integer giving the number of replications.

#labels is a vector of labels for the resulting factor levels.

#Example

v <- gl(5, 3, labels = c("Bombay", "Delhi","Chennai", "coimbatore","Salem"))
print(v)

# factor is a function which find unique elements in a given set of vector
# data frame is set of vectors grouped together
# gl is reverese function of factor, which prints numbers of elements in a vector whose level is mentioned
