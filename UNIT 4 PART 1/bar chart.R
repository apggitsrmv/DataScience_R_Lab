#A bar chart represents data in rectangular bars with length of the bar proportional to the value of the variable. R uses the function barplot() to create bar charts. R can draw both vertical and Horizontal bars in the bar chart. In bar chart each of the bars can be given different colors.

#Syntax
#The basic syntax to create a bar-chart in R is −

#barplot(H,xlab,ylab,main, names.arg,col)
#Following is the description of the parameters used −

#H is a vector or matrix containing numeric values used in bar chart.
#xlab is the label for x axis.
#ylab is the label for y axis.
#main is the title of the bar chart.
#names.arg is a vector of names appearing under each bar.
#col is used to give colors to the bars in the graph.
Example
A simple bar chart is created using just the input vector and the name of each bar.

The below script will create and save the bar chart in the current R working directory.
